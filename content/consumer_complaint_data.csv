I believe this information is inaccurate and is causing substantial harm to my creditworthiness. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), you are required to report accurate information to the credit bureaus. By continuing to report these late payments, you are in violation of the following FCRA provisions : 1. ** 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ** Duty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information. 
2. ** 1681i ( a ) ** Procedure in case of disputed accuracy. 

The continued reporting of these inaccuracies has significantly damaged my credit score, affecting my ability to secure loans and resulting in financial loss. If these errors are not corrected, I will have no choice but to seek legal recourse. 

Litigation will not only demand correction of these errors but also compensation for damages incurred. Based on precedent, I estimate the litigation cost for both parties could exceed {$10000.00}, including but not limited to attorney fees, court costs, and potential statutory and punitive damages.",,OneMain Finance Corporation,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-07-30,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9658522

My online portal was showing a monthly payment due that was {$350.00} more than it should have been. I had already made 11 payments on the loan with my previous servicer that were calculated correctly. I was told a ticket was put in a would take 3-5 days. I received no response and have reached out several more times both through customer service and the online portal and still nobody has fixed the issue. They refuse to look and correct the monthly amount due calcuation which is objectively wrong based on my loan document which they have, my prior statements from the past servicer, and a simple calculation given all the loan terms that their own portal confirms. I am getting strung along and they keep "" opening tickets '' but I am not being allowed to speak to anyone but Customer Service who can't fix anything. My last payment, sent to the previous loan servicer, was applied fully to the principal in error ( this is proven by looking at my principal balance from the XXXX statement and the current principal balance displayed, and also because my current payoff quote is still calculating interest back through XXXX even though I made my monthly XXXX payment. 

I have a payment due soon and I refuse to pay an inflated amount simply because they made an error and will not change the amount to match my SIGNED LOAN CONTRACT.
